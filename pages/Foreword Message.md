“ The Home Team Academy (HTA) plays a pivotal role in developing and nurturing the Home Team (HT) ethos, values and principles in every officer that passed through its training programmes. The Home Team Gallery (HTG) is part of HTA’s training and learning ecosystem, strengthening the HT identity by creating emotional connection and inculcate values of ‘Honour’ and ‘Unity’ among officers. It also promotes HT integration by seeding the “One Home Team” mindset and reiterating the importance of working as an integrated HT, as well as in partnership with the community. In addition, the HTG serves as a platform to instill confidence that HT is dynamic and future ready, and impress upon the public that our officers discharge their duties professionally and with honour. ”
